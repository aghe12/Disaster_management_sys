## 📝 Project Overview

The **Disaster Relief Coordination Platform** is a real-time system developed to manage and distribute critical supplies such as food, shelter, and medical aid during disaster events. It addresses the core challenges of fragmented communication, resource misallocation, and delays by centralizing stakeholder operations and automating workflows.

The platform enables:
- Centralized coordination among NGOs, government bodies, and volunteers
- Real-time data tracking of resources and disaster zones
- Transparent donation and inventory monitoring
- Manual and adaptive resource allocation tailored to evolving disaster conditions

Developed as a **Mini Project** in the 5th semester under the guidance of **Dr. Mustafa Basthikodi** at **Sahyadri College of Engineering & Management**, the system leverages modern web technologies to deliver a practical and scalable disaster relief solution.
